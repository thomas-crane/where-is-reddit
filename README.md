# Where is Reddit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

This web app uses [Chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org/) to show several different visualisations of where the most active users are on reddit. There is also a database with data snapshots being uploaded every 5 minutes to provide historical data.

This web app is hosted using Firebase and can be [found here.](https://where-is-reddit.firebaseapp.com/)
